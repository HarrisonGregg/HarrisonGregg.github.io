		My name is Harrison Gregg.  I am 19 years old and I am currently a senior at Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.  My biggest interests are computer science and entrepreneurship, but I also enjoy abstract math, computer hardware, software development, video games, audiobooks, and open-source software.
