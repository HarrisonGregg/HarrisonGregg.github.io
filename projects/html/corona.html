<p>My first real experience with mobile software development was using the Corona SDK.  I had tried to learn Objective C, but given that I had very little prior programming experience, this proved too difficult.  The Corona SDK, however, was a great way to start out.  I got pretty far with some of my games, but never completed any of them.  At some point, I would like to get them up and running again, but I'm not sure if that's even possible with the latest version of Corona.</p>
