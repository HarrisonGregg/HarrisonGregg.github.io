<p> This was a class project I worked on with <a href="jabdownsmash.com">Aaron Santiago</a> for Combinatorial Algorithms. The mobile app <a href="http://www.famigo.com/app/buttons-and-scissors/">Buttons and Scissors</a> is a puzzle game in which one tries to cut off all of the buttons in the correct order to clear the board of all buttons.  We set out to answer the question, how hard is this game? Not in the subjective sense, but in terms of computational complexity.  We proved that in the case of a board of infinite dimmensions with infinite colors, it is an NP Hard problem to determine the solvability of the game.  To do this, we created a web app that reduces a 3SAT problem to an instance of the Buttons and Scissors game. That is to say, it takes a 3SAT problem as input, and outputs a Buttons and Scissors puzzle, which is solveable if and only if the 3SAT given is solveable.  It can be found at <a href="http://jabdownsmash.com/button3sat/">http://jabdownsmash.com/button3sat/</a>.</p>
