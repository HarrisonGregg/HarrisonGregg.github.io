The second proect for my Computer Graphics class was to create a photorealistic renderer using raytracing.  The theme was easter eggs.  Here are two scenes that I rendered that demonstrate the features of my ray tracer.

From left to right, refractive glass egg, 3D procedurally textured egg, 2D procedurally textured egg, "carved" egg with a reflective egg inside.  Infinite planes make up the ground and sky.

This image shows a rotated cube and four reflective eggs with material constants calculated to make them look like gold, silver, platinum and copper.
