<p>For my Artificial Intelligence class, we did a lot of work with neural nets.  One project I did using the neural nets was to try to predict weather in a certain location based on the previous day's weather in cities nearby in different directions.  In a group project I worked on, we created a handwriting recognizer for individual digits.  We coded 3-layer (input layer, hidden layer, output layer) neural nets from scratch in python.  The source code for this final project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonGregg/numbers-neural-net">https://github.com/HarrisonGregg/numbers-neural-net</a>.</p>
