	This is a spoken dialogue system that I created for a Speech Systems Tutorial at Simon's Rock.  The system provides information about the food and hours of the Simon's ROck Dining Hall. The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonGregg/SRCDHall">https://github.com/HarrisonGregg/SRCDHall</a> and the system can be used at <a href="https://young-plateau-8081.herokuapp.com">https://young-plateau-8081.herokuapp.com</a>.

	All server side logic was programmed in python.  Data is scraped from the HTML of the Dining Hall web page with extensive use of regex and then stored using MongoDB.  Text classification was done using Naive Baisian Classifiers and the server was written using Flask.  The front end was written in HTML and Javascript, using Webkit automatic speach recognition and MeSpeak text to speech.
