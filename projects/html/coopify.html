<p>Coopify is a project with <a href="robinhood.org">The Robin Hood Foundation</a> for Company Challenges at Cornell Tech that will help bring NYC co-ops into the digital age by providing them with an exclusive marketplace to advertise and schedule their services.  We're using Django for the backend, and Angular with Ionic for the frontend.  The development version can be viewed <a href="http://damp-shore-3980.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
