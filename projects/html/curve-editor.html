<p>Our first assignment for my Computer Graphics class at AIT Budapest was to make a curve editor in OpenGL that could create different kinds of curves, including polylines, Bezier curves, Catmull-Rom splines, and Lagrange curves.  The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonGregg/curve-editor">https://github.com/HarrisonGregg/curve-editor</a>.</p>

This image shows the four curve type, polyline, Bezier curve, Lagrange, and Catmull-Rom spline, from left to right on similar control points.
