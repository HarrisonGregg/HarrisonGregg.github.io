<p>Synthepyzer is a project that the Simon's Rock College coding club, SRC Coders, created at HackPrinceton Fall 2013.  It was a program written in python for music synthesis.  We originally had higher aspirations for the project, but were heavily limited by the capabilities of the python sound library we were using. </p>
