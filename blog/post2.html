This past week was focused on getting technologies set up.  
</p>
<p>
My first accomplishment this past week was getting a basic blog set up on my website.  If you are not viewing this post on the website, the blog can be found at http://www.harrisongregg.com/#/blog.  In the future, hopefully I'll have time to make it prettier, but it is as functional as it needs to be right now.  
</p>
I also started setting up an Agile project management software.  I've decided to start out by trying Atlassian JIRA, as it seems very popular, and I have some experience using it.  There is a 7 day trial that I can start with though, so I'll give it a few days before I decide if I want to pay for it.  JIRA with the Agile add on costs $20/month for up to 10 users, which is not unreasonable, but I regret not thinking of this cost when filling out my thesis budget request form.  Hopefully, JIRA will allow me to organize my project easily, budget time effectively, and show others how much I am getting done. 
<p>
Also, the survey I had prepared last week is still ready to send out, but I will wait to send it out until I have met with Anne O'Dwyer to discuss what I need to do to comply with the Human Research Review Committee guidelines.  I have a meeting scheduled with her for tomorrow, so I should be able to get the survey sent out tomorrow evening.  Hopefully I will have some responses to consider before my post next week.

So, for next week, I will have set up JIRA completely, tried it for a few days, and decided if I would like to use the software for developing my product.  I will also have sent out the survey I discussed last week, and reviewed the preliminary data to start making some decisions about the direction of this project.
