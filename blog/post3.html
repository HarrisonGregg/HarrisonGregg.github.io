	This past week, I was disillusioned about how long it takes to prepare a survey to be distributed, given the HRRC guidelines on doing so.  I met with Anne O'Dwyer about what is necessary to include in a survey distributed to medical professionals, and we determined that for this purpose, I simply need an agreement at the beginning of the survey detailing what is expected of the person filling out the survey, and what my intentions are for the information gathered.  I have prepared an initial <i>Informed Consent Form</i>, but it must now be reviewed by Anne and 2 other HRRC members.  Here is a copy of my <a href="blog/informed-consent-form-draft1.pdf" target="_blank">first draft</a>.  Hopefully this will be done within a week and I can begin to distribute the survey.  Anne also warned that completing the HRRC process for anything involving patients and sensitive patient information is going to take much longer, so I should start that process soon.

	I also started creating a <a href="http://leanstack.com/" target="_blank">Lean Canvas</a>.  My current draft can be found <a href="lean-canvas.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  To create the Lean Canvas, I needed to come up with a preliminary name for the product I will be creating.  For now, I chose the name <i>Axonic Health</i>.  I chose the word <i>axon</i> because it is the part of a neuron that sends information, and the purpose of my product is to let patients send information to their doctors.  I am open to suggestions for alternatives.

	I haven't gotten too far in getting a project management tool set up, but I've decided on using the tool <a href="http://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>.  It's user interface is very intuitive and simple, and it is recommended for small development teams.  It is a general team management tool, not limited to use for software development, and given the multifaceted nature of my project, I think this will be useful.  It also has an extensive free tier of its software, unlimited by time, as opposed to the 7 day trial offered by Atlassian for JIRA and $20/month fee after that for the basic package and Scrum add on.  I think that Trello should be more than sufficient for my needs.

	Though it is not strictly a part of my thesis, I also redesigned my website completely using Bootstrap, which has made it much more user friendly and portable.
