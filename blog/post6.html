I didn't get a lot done this week that directly contributed to my thesis.  But I attended the Connected Health Symposium hosted by <a href "http://connectedhealth.partners.org/">The Center for Connected Health</a> in Boston.  The Symposium really taught me a lot about the field that I'm trying to enter with this product.  Speaking to people there, I heard about a few behavioral health software products that are available, but none of them are trying to accomplish exactly what I am.  Unlike other products, mine is just aiming to facilitate the interaction between care providers and patients, not perform any treatment on its own.  However, the idea of monitoring patients, particularly ones that have been recently released from the hospital, is a very popular concenpt.  A number of companies are appraoching this problem in different ways.  However, as a representative from one of the companies told me, they are really going after the low hanging fruit.  Monitoring a patients heart remotely after they've been released from the hospital after their heart surgery is low risk and high reward.  Behavioral health, on the other hand, is a much trickier and riskier field to get into.  I'll try not to be too daunted by this.  This conference in general also gave me a better understanding of the software I'm trying to make and how to describe it.  I've realized that what I'm working on can be accurately and succinctly described as <i>behavioral health monitoring</i>, though I might not want to advertise it to patients as such.

One thing I was able to do this week was send out my market survey.  I sent it to about 18 medical personnel who are qualified to answer it.  Unfortunately, so far, I've only received two responses.  I asked my mom to send out an email asking again if they would complete the survey, but I'll also explore other options for improving turnout.

I also submitted the next HRRC Proposal for performing User Interface Testing, so hopefully that will be completed by the time that I am ready for that stage of production.  At this point, it looks like I might miss the next deadline as well, which was to have a full description of the envisioned software, and have completed preliminary user interface testing by November 3rd.  I will try to have the process begun by that point though, which will be my focus for completing for next week.
