The HRRC procedure is almost at an end.  Well, at least it is for my first trip through it.  I met with Anne O'Dwyer to go over the changes suggested by the second reviewer of the HRRC Proposal and the survey.  The suggested changes were minimal, but I agreed with and implemented most of them.  Anne said that the proposal now needs to be sent back to and approved by the second reviewer, then sent to the third reviewer.  Apparently, the third reviewer has a reputation for a quick turn around time, so I should hear back regarding their suggestions sometime tomorrow.  After that, I assume the material will need to be sent back one more time for final approval, and then I can send out the survey.  I have said it a few times before, but this time I think I will actually have some survey results to discuss within the next week.

As this process has taken significantly longer than originally anticipated, I mean to get a head start on the next round.  If I can accomplish all that I set out to in the course of my thesis, I will have to go through this process at least a few times more.  I have also been warned that this time through will likely be one of the easier runs, though hopefully I will also become more efficient at it with time.  The future proposals that I will need to make are for user interface testing of the care provider side of the software with medical personnel, user interface testing of the patient side of the software, and live testing of the software with care providers and actual patients.  By the time I post my update next week, I will submit HRRC proposals for all of these so that I do not get held up by the process again.

Over break last week, I attended the FOLEY Tech Summit 2014 in Boston.  The two topics emphasized at this summit that were of particular interest to me were mHealth and data security.  mHealth is the idea of healthcare moving into the realm of mobile devices, and as this often involves sensitive medical records this relates to information security.  I learned a lot at the summit, and met lots of interesting people.  I asked one person for advice on this project, and there were a few things that he emphasized that I thought were particularly important.  He asked what sort of market that I have for my software, and recommended that I find a very specific market to sell to first.  Then, use this group to gain leverage into more of the potential customer-base.  This is exactly what I've been planning on doing with the contacts that my mother gave me.  He also suggested working on user-interface design, before actually doign any coding, something I've been intending to do.  Finally, when I asked for advice about what sort of back-end to use for software like this from a security perspective, he said that many of the commonly used back-end services, such as Amazon Web Services provide the necessary external security.  However, I recognize that I will still need to ensure that my software has the necessary internal security, i.e., I need to make sure that the right people have access to the right information at all times.  I will look further into providers such as Amazon and into the HIPAA regulations to start figuring out how I'll handle security.

I will also be attending a <i>Connected Health Symposium</i> in Boston Thursday and Friday this week, where I'm sure I'll learn a lot more about the field.

The other thing that I did over break last week was spend a while working with PhoneGap, starting to learn how it works.  I spent a very long time struggling with HTML and CSS, trying to get things that format perfectly in a web browser to look right within a native phonegap application and was having little success.  I have since realized that there are much better ways to approach this problem, such as using additional libraries for user interface design.  I haven't had much of a chance to explore it extensively, but I have been having more luck so far with a library called jQuery Mobile.  It might not offer all of the features that I need, but I have already accomplished more with it that I did after spending days just writing my own HTML and CSS.
