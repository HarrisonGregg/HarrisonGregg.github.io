This is the first of what will be weekly updates on the progress of my Senior Thesis.  At this point, this is my working description of my project:
</p>
<p>
For my thesis project, I will undertake the task of planning, creating, and starting to run an information technology business.  This will include performing market research, going through the formal process of creating a business, developing a software product, and creating a business plan for the potential future of the business.  As the product, I will develop a simple, intuitive, and useful piece of software that can be used by healthcare professionals to facilitate their daily work.
</p>
<p>
This will likely evolve and in the future, but it will hopefully not change drastically.  At this point, I also have an idea for the software that I will be creating.  I think that this idea sounds very promising, but, as part of the nature of my project is as a business, I will not definitively accept this as my software product until I have completed market research that confirms a demand for such a product.  Here is the current description of this software product as I currently envision it:
</p>
<p>
The piece of software I develop will allow medical personnel who treat patients with psychiatric disorders to more effectively collect data from their patients between appointments.  This would consist of a patient-side app that could be accessed on a smartphone, in which patients could provide information, such as quality of sleep or mood.  A doctor-side webapp would allow doctors to view data provided by patients and information created through analysis of the data in multiple ways, allowing psychiatrists to more easily keep track of long term trends in a patientâ€™s well-being, get more timely feedback on changes in medication, and generally improve quality of care.
</p>
<p>
Up to this point, I have been preparing my <a href="blog/thesis-proposal.pdf" target="_blank">Senior Thesis Proposal</a>, deciding on the nature of the software product that I would like to design, and preparing material for performing market research.  This past week, I finished my Senior Thesis Proposal and my Budget Request and turned them in. I have also created a survey to be filled out by medical professionals to whom this software might be of interest. As soon as I determine what procedures I need to follow to comply with Human Research Review Committee guidelines, I will begin distributing this survey.  
</p>
<p>
There are a few priorities that I have for completion this next week.  My primary priority is choosing and setting up a project management tool.  Once I set this up, I will be able to list all of the tasks that I need to complete, and easily choose specific tasks that I wish to complete each sprint.
