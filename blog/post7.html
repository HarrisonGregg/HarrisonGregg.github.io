The Thesis Posters are up!  At Simon's Rock, each senior prepares a description of their thesis and provides some graphics to be used in a poster.  Then, the students in the Graphic Design class create posters using this material.  The posters are then put up in the Student Union building for all to see.  So, this doesn't reflect any work that I've done, but the posters were put up last week and I'm pretty pleased with how mine turned out:

I also wrote a <a href="outline1.pdf" target="_blank">preliminary outline</a> of the written part of my thesis.  In general, I think the written portion will be a chronological account of the project, focusing on what I learn during the process.

I also wanted to mention the results of the survey that I sent out, or more acurately, the lack of results.  I have only recieved 3 responses to the survey, which I sent out to about 18 people.  Those responses were useful and optimistic about the market potential for my product, but I have learned that sending out a survey was definitely not what I should have been doing at this point.
