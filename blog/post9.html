I've just submitted the preliminary version of my app to the Google Play Store!  It naturally took longer than expected, but hopefully I can get people to install it and ask for some feedback.  I've determined that the app does not need to be HIPAA compliant, if only patients input data into the app.  However, I decided that having a Privacy Policy for the app would be a good idea, so that's <a href="/privacy.txt">here</a>.  I've decided to start writing shorter posts, so I can just say anything as soon as it comes to mind.  I'll post again about the result of the app being published.
