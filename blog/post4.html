	The HRRC process has progressed, but it has yet to be completed.  Anne O'Dwyer provided lots of feedback for changes to the informed consent form, but then reminded me that I needed to submit an HRRC Proposal before the process could continue.  I've submitted the <a href="blog/HRRCProposal.pdf" target="_blank"> proposal </a> and updated the <a href="blog/informed-consent-form-draft2.pdf" target="_blank">informed consent form</a> per Anne's suggestions.  The form still needs to go through to rounds of review, but that should definitely be finished by the end of break next week.

	At this point, due to the delays caused by the HRRC process, I am behind schedule.  I was supposed to have completed the market research by last Friday, but have yet to begin it.  I am going to move forward with the assumption that the market research will show that the product idea proposed has some market viability.  This should not prevent me from meeting the deadline of November 3rd for having a "full description of the envisioned software," and having "completed preliminary user interface testing."

	This past week, I also started using Trello, and it looks like it should be sufficient for my needs.

	I did not get a chance to start learning how to use PhoneGap, but I will certainly have a chance to do this over break next week.

	I met with my third reader, James Jeffries, to discuss my initial progress with the Venture Deck and the Lean Canvas. He expressed concern about my <i>Unique Value Proposition</i>. After discussing it with Dr. Linda Smothers (my mom), I have made minor updates to the Lean Canvas to include the value proposition that I hope to offer of decreasing the frequency at which patients do not show up to their appointments.  This is a serious problem for many doctors, with no-show rates sometimes up to 50% in some practices.  Decreasing this rate would make the doctors' work much more efficient and easily organized.  I have also decided to work with the name <i>FollowUp</i> for the time being.  It follow the current trend of simple software names, and I think it has a nice ring to it, referencing the follow-up appointment one makes with a doctor, as well as imploring the patients to follow up with the doctor and take control of their own care.  <a href="blog/lean-canvas2.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is the updated Lean Canvas.  James also mentioned that <a href="ginkoapp.com" target="_blank">GinkoApp</a> has a business plan template designed by him, inspired by his Venture Deck.  Within the next week, I will create a GinkoApp business plan
