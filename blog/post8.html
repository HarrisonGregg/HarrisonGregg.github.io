Last week I got a chance to have lunch with a few psychiatry residents from the Berkshire Medical Center to discuss my project.  The general concensus was that the idea that I am working on has good potential.  They also gave me a better idea of what would make the software truly useful to them.  For example, doctors already have things like paper sleep charts and surveys that they can give to their patients to fill out before their next appointment.  However, reading the collected data then takes time, although it might not be too difficult.  So it would be useful to have software that could automatically parse the information collected on a survey.  I also asked about how software like this could provide monetary value.  One point I had already considered was that care providers lose a significant amount of money on patients that don't show up, so increasing patient engagement and decreasing no-shows could provide significant value.  Additionally, the cost of a visit to a doctor is determined by the "complexity of care", which is decided by things like whether a prescription change was made during the appointment.  So, if the software could decrease the need for appointments with lower complexity of care, then the doctors' time could be used more effectively for the things that really require their expertise.  The doctors also made it very clear that they weren't interested in giving patients a way to contact them directly, or increasing their liability at all.  For example, if the software identified concerning results in a survey taken by a patient, the software should tell direct the patient to emergency services instead of alerting the doctor.

Based on the information gather, I have created a preliminary user interface.  This interface does not have any backend functionality and was created exclusively in HTML and CSS, using the jQuery Mobile library.  It can be viewed <a href="thesis/index.html">here</a>.
